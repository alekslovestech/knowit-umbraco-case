Case Title: Senior Backend Developer
Case Task Summary (Translated to English):

You are to create a simple Umbraco website and a database exposed via a REST API.

The database should contain some items — you are free to decide what these items are (e.g., users, products, or anything else).

The API should support the following operations:

- Create an item
- Get a specific item
- Get all items
- Delete an item

_The frontend is not part of the task. You may use Postman to demonstrate the API._

The Umbraco site must include:

- A header and footer

- Editors should be able to create pages where the header and footer are automatically included

- Pages should allow insertion of dynamic components in a designated content area

- Editors should be able to reorder components

Additional Considerations (You may reflect on):
You should consider or briefly mention ideas about:

- Scalability
- Performance
- Extensibility
- Database migrations
- Maintainability
- Code commenting/documentation
- PIM (Product Information Management)
- Azure DevOps (pipelines / build server setup)
- Hosting (e.g., Azure, on-premise)

Bonus Features (Optional, if you have time):

- Swagger API documentation
- Search functionality
- Caching layer
- Unit testing
- Email integration (e.g., with SendGrid)

Time & Presentation Guidelines:

- Spend no more than 3–5 hours on the task
- You may present the case in any visual format, e.g., PowerPoint
- You don’t need to submit it in advance
- You will have 15–20 minutes to present it during the second interview

The case is meant as a starting point for a discussion, not a final product
